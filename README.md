# Mihail's Chat

>_I have written a tutorial about how I did this. You can find it [here](https://mihail-gaberov.eu/how-i-build-chat-app-with-react-and-typescript-part1/) or [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/build-a-chat-app-with-react-typescript-and-socket-io-d7e1192d288),
or [here](https://dev.to/mihailgaberov/how-to-build-a-chat-app-with-react-typescript-and-socket-io-2e1c)_

A React single page chat application (SPA) built with the following technologies:
- React with TypeScript (`create-react-app my-app --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts`)
- Redux
- Express.js with Socket.io
- styled-components (SASS)
- Jest/Enzyme/Sinon

- Settings page

  ### Improvements (done and pending)
   - Add video chat feature.
   - :+1: Added AM/PM time formatting for when 12h mode is selected.
   - :+1: Added possibility to send message via ENTER by default. If the setting to send messages with CTRL+ENTER is ON, then this is going to be the only way (except via mouse/touch of course).
   - :+1: Optimized for iDevices (media queries).
   - :+1: Fix blinking/active class for the Chat tab issue - related to React Router not able to properly re-render connected components https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/packages/react-router/docs/guides/blocked-updates.md
   - :+1: Clear input field when new message is sent.
   - :+1: Auto scroll to bottom main chat area when new messages exceed available space.
   - :+1: Prevent 'doubling messages' (or multiple messages duplicates when more clients are connected).
   - :+1: Add unit tests for the react components.
   - Add unit tests for redux stuff - reducers, store, action creators.
   - :+1: Add media queries for responsiveness - test and adjust on more devices.
   - :+1: Add demo to heroku.
   - :+1: Add nice how-to in README.
   - Add animations for the messages (animejs).
   - Add sounds (with options to turn on/off in settings).
   - Add more color themes.
   - Add welcome message (broadcasts on user connected).
   - :+1: Add icons ( use font awesome).
   - History of all the conversations.
   - Handle case when socket's connection state change (visually).
   - Handle case when there has been a socket error.
   - Handle case when a very long word (without) spaces is entered and it goes beyond the message background color.
   - :+1: Emoticons support - such as :D, :P, :), ;), :wink:, :heart:, etc.
   - :+1: Link Parser - youtube link (embedded video should appear), link to an image (embedded image should appear), all other links should appear as anchor.
  
### Demo
:star: [mihails-chat.herokuapp.com](https://mihails-chat.herokuapp.com) :star:

### Running The App locally

To run the app, follow these steps.

1. Ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) is installed.
2. Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
3. From the project folder, execute the following commands:

To install dependencies:
```shell
  npm i
```
To run the client app:

```shell
  npm start
```
To run the server app:

```shell
  npm run server:watch
```
To run the tests:

```shell
  npm t
```
Browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and see the running app. In order to test, open it in two different computers,
 or computer and a phone, or two browsers on the same computer (one of it in incognito mode). 
 _If you are running it locally, make sure to change the __host__ variable in Socket.ts (line:28) and its value to match
 your local network address - the one of the computer you are running the server app._ 
 

### Deploy to Heroku 
_This step assumes you have already a Heroku account, installed heroku-cli and did login._

1. `npm build` to build the project to `build` folder.
2. Add `build` folder to be committed to Git
3. Make sure that express server loads static resources from it.
4. Commit all: `git commit -m 'Deploy to Heroky'`.
5. Run `git push heroku master`.
6. Open the app from the given URL (in my case: [mihails-chat.herokuapp.com](https://mihails-chat.herokuapp.com)).
